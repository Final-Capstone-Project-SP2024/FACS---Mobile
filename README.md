## Some suggestion
color can be reference from vneid
consider put user fullname beside the profile icon
maybe considering the whole dashboard background color to be the same as the status
logo must be matching color pallette

button = middle, or stretch the whole width

button match the same size on the same page 

=> having a class for button (name, color)
